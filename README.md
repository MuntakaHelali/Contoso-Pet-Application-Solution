# Contoso-Pet-Application-Solution

The Contoso Pets Application is used to find homes for stray or abandoned dogs and cats. The application already had the main menu design and functionality completed. 
Option 3 and 4 are completed using iteration statements, user input, and arithmitic calculation. 

Option 3 is the feature that ensures animal ages and physical descriptions of the existing animals in the database are complete. If not, the user can input "3" in the menu and fill out the missing data.
